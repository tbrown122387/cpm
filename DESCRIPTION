Description: The primary function makeCPMSampler() generates a sampler function which performs the correlated pseudo-marginal method of Deligiannidis, Doucet and Pitt (2017) <arXiv:1511.04992>. If the 'rho=' argument of makeCPMSampler() is set to 0, then the generated sampler function performs the original pseudo-marginal method of Andrieu and Roberts (2009) <DOI:10.1214/07-AOS574>. The sampler function is constructed with the user's choice of prior, parameter proposal distribution, and the likelihood approximation scheme. Note that this algorithm is not automatically tuned--each one of these arguments must be carefully chosen.
